    <!-- 6. USER-GENERATED CONTENT -->
    <section data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="500">
      <h2>6. Profiles, Homes and User-Generated Content</h2>

      <h3>6.1. Responsibility for Content</h3>
      <p>
        All content you publish (text, photos, messages, etc.) is your sole responsibility. You warrant that the
        content is truthful, that you hold the necessary rights and that it does not infringe the rights of third parties.
        Vestal may remove content that it considers to be in breach of these Terms.
      </p>

      <h3>6.2. License to Use Content</h3>
      <p>
        By publishing content in the App, you grant Vestal a non-exclusive, free, worldwide and transferable license
        to use, reproduce and display such content for the purpose of providing the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Duration of the license:</strong> This license remains in force for as long as your account is active
        or the content is published. Profile photos and home listings will be deleted along with your account, unless
        they form part of a collaborative history necessary for other users.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Exception:</strong> For content shared in collaborative environments (such as home chat messages,
        incident history or votes) that must be retained to ensure a coherent service for other users, the license
        will survive the deletion of your account. In such cases, Vestal may retain this content and may choose to
        anonymize the author (e.g. displaying it as “Deleted user”).
      </p>

      <h3>6.3. Chats and Communication</h3>
      <p>
        Chats in Vestal are associated with homes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Messages are only visible to participants in the chat.</li>
        <li>
          If you delete your account, your previous messages may remain visible to the current housemates of that home
          for historical coherence (in line with the license described in section 6.2).
        </li>
        <li>You must always maintain a respectful tone.</li>

        Internal votes or opinions regarding an applicant are private to the home and are not shown to the applicant

      <p>
        We may suspend or cancel your account in case of breach of these Terms, fraudulent use or legal requirement.
        Where possible, we will inform you of the reason for the suspension, unless the law, service security

      <h3>11.3. Exclusion of the Right of Withdrawal</h3>
      <p>
        As this is a digital content service that is not provided on a tangible medium and whose execution begins
        with the user’s prior explicit consent (by registering and using the App), the user acknowledges that they
        lose their right of withdrawal once the service has begun, in accordance with applicable consumer regulations.
