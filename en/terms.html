    <!-- 6. USER-GENERATED CONTENT -->
    <section data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="500">
      <h2>6. Profiles, Homes and User-Generated Content</h2>

      <h3>6.1. Responsibility for Content and Flagging Mechanism</h3>
      <p>
        All content you publish (including text, photos, listings, messages and any other material)
        is your sole responsibility. You warrant that such content is accurate, lawful, and does not
        infringe the rights of third parties or these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vestal provides users with tools to <strong>flag or report content</strong> that they believe
        is unlawful, inappropriate, or non-compliant with these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Upon being flagged</strong>, the reported content may be <strong>temporarily hidden or
        made inaccessible</strong> while Vestal carries out a further review. This provisional measure
        does not imply that a breach has occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following investigation, Vestal may decide to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Restore the content if no breach is confirmed;</li>
        <li>Modify, restrict or permanently remove the content;</li>
        <li>Apply measures to the associated account, where appropriate.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Vestal acts in good faith and with due diligence, but does not guarantee specific response times.
      </p>

      <h3>6.2. License to Use Content</h3>
      <p>
        By publishing content in the App, you grant Vestal a non-exclusive, free, worldwide and transferable license
        to use, reproduce and display such content for the purpose of providing the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Duration of the license:</strong> This license remains in force for as long as your account is active
        or the content is published. Profile photos and home listings will be deleted along with your account, unless
        they form part of a collaborative history necessary for other users.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Exception:</strong> For content shared in collaborative environments (such as home chat messages,
        incident history or votes) that must be retained to ensure a coherent service for other users, the license
        will survive the deletion of your account. In such cases, Vestal may retain this content and may choose to
        anonymize the author (e.g. displaying it as “Deleted user”).
      </p>

      <h3>6.3. Chats and Communication</h3>
      <p>
        Chats in Vestal are associated with homes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Messages are only visible to participants in the chat.</li>
        <li>
          If you delete your account, your previous messages may remain visible to the current housemates of that home
          for historical coherence (in line with the license described in section 6.2).
        </li>
        <li>You must always maintain a respectful tone.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7.1. Vestal as a Technology Intermediary</h3>
      <p>
        Vestal is solely a technology platform. We do not participate in lease agreements, rent payments, deposits
        or moving arrangements.
      </p>

      <h3>7.2. Verification and Behavior</h3>
      <p>
        Vestal does not guarantee the real identity of users nor the complete accuracy of the information posted.
        We are not responsible for users’ offline behavior.
      </p>
      <p>We recommend that you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visit homes in person before committing to them.</li>
        <li>Do not send money or banking details without verifying the identity and legitimacy of the recipient.</li>
        <li>Require written and legally valid lease agreements.</li>
        <li>Report suspicious or inappropriate behavior.</li>
        <li>Use your own judgment and carry out the necessary checks before making decisions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7.3. Reporting Users, Homes and Non-Compliant Content</h3>
      <p>
        Vestal does not carry out prior or systematic monitoring of all user content. However,
        users may <strong>flag or report</strong> any profile, home, message or behaviour that they
        reasonably believe to be unlawful, fraudulent, unsafe or contrary to these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reports can be submitted through the in-App reporting tools or by contacting us at
        <a href="mailto:vestal.theapp@gmail.com">vestal.theapp@gmail.com</a>, including all relevant
        information (such as user identification, description of the issue, and supporting evidence).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Once content is reported</strong>, Vestal may <strong>temporarily remove or hide it</strong>
        from the App while an internal investigation is conducted to determine whether a breach
        of these Terms or applicable law has occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        After review, Vestal may, in accordance with applicable law and at its sole discretion:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Confirm the breach and permanently remove the content;</li>
        <li>Restore the content if no violation is found;</li>
        <li>Suspend, restrict or terminate the relevant user account;</li>
        <li>Limit certain functionalities;</li>
        <li>Notify competent authorities where legally required.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The use of reporting mechanisms must be made in good faith. <strong>Abusive, false or
        repetitive unfounded reports</strong> may be considered misuse of the Service and may result
        in account suspension or termination.

        We may suspend or cancel your account in case of breach of these Terms, fraudulent use or legal requirement.
      </p>

      <h3>11.2. Cancellation by the User</h3>
      <p>
        You can delete your account at any time from within the App or by contacting support.
      </p>

      <h3>11.3. Exclusion of the Right of Withdrawal</h3>
      <p>
        As this is a digital content service that is not provided on a tangible medium and whose execution begins
        with the user’s prior explicit consent (by registering and using the App), the user acknowledges that they
        lose their right of withdrawal once the service has begun, in accordance with applicable consumer regulations.
        However, you may stop using the service and close your account at any time.

      <h2>12. Availability and Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        Vestal does not guarantee uninterrupted availability of the Service. We may perform maintenance, updates or
        temporarily suspend access for technical or security reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vestal is not responsible for the loss of content or data due to technical failures, service interruptions
        or account deletions. We recommend that you keep backups of important information.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, Vestal shall not be liable for indirect damages, conflicts between users
        or information provided by them. Nothing in these Terms limits our liability where such limitation is not allowed
        by law (such as in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence).
      </p>
      <p>
      Vestal reserves the right to limit the number of new registrations or temporarily restrict functionalities, without 
      this giving rise to any right to compensation.

      <h2>15. Modification, suspension and termination of the Service</h2>
      <p>
        Vestal may, at any time, introduce improvements, changes or new versions of the App and the Service,
        as well as modify, reorganize or remove certain features, provided that this does not entail an
        unjustified reduction of the users’ basic rights recognized by the applicable regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, Vestal may <strong>limit, suspend or temporarily interrupt</strong> access to the App
        for technical, security or maintenance reasons, or due to the user’s breach of these Terms.
        To the extent reasonably possible, Vestal will attempt to give prior notice of such interruptions,
        unless urgent reasons or force majeure prevent this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vestal may also, at any time, <strong>decide to permanently discontinue the Service and close the App</strong>.
        In such case, and whenever reasonably possible, users will be informed with reasonable advance notice
        through the App itself, by email or other appropriate means
        (such as social networks), indicating the effective closing date and the consequences for user accounts and
        associated content.
      </p>
      <p>
        The processing of personal data after the suspension or closure of the Service will be governed by the provisions
        of the corresponding <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>, including the applicable retention periods and
        security measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing in this clause limits the non-waivable rights to which users are entitled
        as consumers and users under applicable law.
